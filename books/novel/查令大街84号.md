1 the first letter,1949 10 5 from Helene Hanff .

the first letter described Helena Hanff herself was a poor writer with an antiquarian taste in books, but no ability to get over except rare expensive editions, or makred-up schoolboy copies in a grimy book store.

Helene Hanff said she was very satisfied with the books, made a comparison between usa and england books, then she asked to order bible mentioned in the second letter, and attached money estimated for these books.

4 replay to HH, 1949 11 9

the store adviced HH to send money by postal money order rather than just entrusting dollar bills to the emails. Then sent off the New Testaments and invoice including amount due in both pounds and dollars. so an invoice could contain different amounts?
